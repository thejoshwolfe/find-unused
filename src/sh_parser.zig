//! See `man bash` for the reference for this module.
//! This only implements a subset that I find useful.
//! Note that unlike python's shlex module, this parser can distinguish between these:
//!  $ a=b cmd1 && cmd2
//!  $ "a=b" cmd1 "&&" cmd2
//! Unfortunately, this means that the API here is very complex compared to just an array of strings.
